# User Roles and Permissions

This documentation outlines the permissions and actions available to users in the roles of **User**, **Administrator**, and **Owner**. Permissions are applied to two primary entities: **User** and **Author**.

## Roles and Permissions Overview

### 👤 User Roles
| **Role**          | **Level** | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Member**        | 3         | Standard user with limited access to their own account and author profile.      |
| **Administrator** | 2         | System administrator with full access to all user accounts and author profiles. |
| **Owner**         | 1         | System owner with full control over all user accounts and author profiles.      |

### Role Level Hierarchy

The **level** field establishes a hierarchical authority structure for role assignment and access control:

- **Level 1 (Owner)**: Highest authority - can assign any role including Owner
- **Level 2 (Administrator)**: Mid-level authority - can assign Administrator and Member roles, but NOT Owner
- **Level 3 (Member)**: Entry level - cannot assign roles to others

Lower level numbers indicate higher authority. This hierarchy prevents privilege escalation by ensuring users can only assign roles at their level or below.

**How it works:**
When assigning roles, users can only assign roles with a level greater than or equal to their own level.

**Examples:**
- ✅ Administrator (level 2) can assign Administrator (level 2) or Member (level 3) roles
- ❌ Administrator (level 2) CANNOT assign Owner (level 1) role
- ✅ Owner (level 1) can assign any role (all levels ≥ 1)
- ❌ Member (level 3) cannot assign any roles (no administrative access)
