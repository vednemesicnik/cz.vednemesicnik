# About the Project

## What Problems It Solves
The website for the student magazine serves as a versatile platform for publishing and sharing content, including articles, podcast episodes, and archived PDF issues. It also provides information about the editorial team and the organization's goals in supporting student activities.

Unlike generic publishing platforms that often impose limitations, this custom-built website is designed to be flexible and adaptable. For instance, it integrates podcast features seamlessly, overcoming challenges that many standard platforms face.

By offering this tailored platform, students can use it not only for publishing but also as a space for creative exploration, aligned with their evolving needs and ambitions.

## Architecture and Technologies
The project leverages modern web technologies for scalability and maintainability:
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainable code.
- **React**: Provides dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Enables efficient server-side JavaScript execution.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for application data storage.
- **Prisma**: Simplifies database interactions with a modern, type-safe ORM.
- **Vite**: Optimizes front-end development with fast builds and hot module replacement.
- **NPM**: Manages dependencies and scripts efficiently.

## Libraries Overview

### Core Libraries
- **React Ecosystem**:
  - `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router`

### State Management and Validation
- **Form Handling**:
  - `@conform-to/react`, `@conform-to/zod`, `@mjackson/form-data-parser`
- **Schema Validation**:
  - `zod`

### Utilities

  - `@epic-web/remember`, `@epic-web/invariant`, `@paralleldrive/cuid2`

### Styling and Animations
- **Styling**:
  - `@liborgabrhel/style-utils`
- **Animations**:
  - `@react-spring/web`

### Database and Security
- **Database**:
  - `@prisma/client`, `prisma`
- **Security**:
  - `bcryptjs`, `crypto-js`, `@simplewebauthn/browser`, `@simplewebauthn/server`

### Development Tools
- **Linting and Formatting**:
  - `eslint`, `prettier`, `stylelint`
- **TypeScript Support**:
  - `typescript`, `tsx`, `vite-tsconfig-paths`
- **Testing**:

## Code and Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **`app/`**: Core application code, including components, routes, and utilities.
- **`docker/`**: Docker configuration for containerization.
- **`docs/`**: Project documentation.
- **`prisma/`**: Database schema and migration files.
- **`public/`**: Static assets like images and fonts.
- **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts for tasks like database management.

Components are styled with CSS modules for encapsulation and reuse. Non-route-specific components are in `app/components`, while route-specific components are organized under `app/routes`.

## Technical Challenges
- Managing nested routes and dynamic parameters.
- Implementing breadcrumb navigation.
- Ensuring reusable and maintainable components.
- Handling image processing and progressive loading.
- Role-based access control and content lifecycle management.

## Future Plans
- Enhance UI/UX and accessibility.
- Optimize performance for faster load times.
- Simplify the administration interface.
- Reduce dependencies by removing outdated libraries.
- Implement dark mode and improve test coverage.
- Upgrade to React 19 to leverage new features.
- Strengthen authentication with WebAuthN and other modern methods.
- Improve SEO and metadata handling for better search visibility.
- Integrate analytics and tracking for user insights.
- Implement a commenting system and social sharing features.

## Summary
This project provides a flexible platform tailored to the needs of a student magazine, enabling efficient content management and creative expression. Built with modern technologies and a clear vision for future enhancements, it ensures scalability, maintainability, and an evolving feature set.
