# About the Project

## What Problems It Solves
This project is designed to manage and administer podcasts, issues, users, and editorial board members. It provides a comprehensive administration interface for managing various aspects of a podcast platform, including adding, editing, and deleting podcasts, episodes, users, and more.

## Architecture and Technologies
The project is built using the following technologies:
- **TypeScript**: Used for type-safe JavaScript development, ensuring better code quality and maintainability.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side, enabling efficient back-end development.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight SQL database used for managing and storing application data.
- **Prisma**: A modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for working with databases, enabling type-safe and efficient database queries.
- **Vite**: A fast and modern build tool and development server for front-end development, optimized for performance and efficient workflow.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: A tool for managing project dependencies, libraries, and scripts efficiently.

## Code and Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:
- `app/`: Contains the main application code, including components, routes, styles, and utilities.
- `docker/`: Contains Docker configuration files for containerizing the application.
- `docs/`: Contains documentation files for the project.
- `prisma/`: Contains Prisma configuration files for managing the database schema and migrations.
- `public/`: Contains public assets such as images, fonts, and other static files.
- `scripts/`: Contains utility scripts for docker, database, and other tasks.

The code is formatted and linted using ESLint, Prettier and Stylelint to ensure consistent code style and quality.
All non-route specific components are located in the `app/components` directory, while route-specific components are located in the `app/routes` directory inside their respective route folders.
For easier development, components are using CSS modules for styling, ensuring encapsulation and reusability.
Files and folders are named using kebab-case for consistency and readability. 
For better visual organization, supporting files start with an underscore `_` prefix to separate them from main folder files (e.g. `index.ts` or `route.tsx`).

## Technical Challenges and Future Plans
### Technical Challenges
- **Routing Complexity**: Managing nested routes and dynamic parameters for a large number of administration functionalities.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Implementing breadcrumb navigation for better user experience and navigation.
- **Styling**: Managing global styles and component-specific styles using regular CSS and CSS modules.
- **Component Reusability**: Ensuring components are reusable and maintainable across different parts of the application.
- **Image Processing**: Handling image uploads and downloads, resizing, and optimization for better performance.
- **Progressive Image Loading**: Implementing progressive image loading for better performance and user experience.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implementing role-based access control for different user/author roles and permissions.
- **Content Lifecycle Management**: Managing the lifecycle of content, including drafts, published content and archived content.


### Future Plans
- **Improved UI/UX**: Enhancing the user interface for better usability and accessibility.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing the application for faster load times and better performance.
- **Enhanced Administration**: Creating a more simple and user-friendly administration interface.
- **Old Packages Reduction**: Removing outdated and unused packages to reduce the application's size and complexity. Mainly focusing on the `crypto-js` and `remix-utils` packages.
- **React v.19**: Upgrading to the latest version of React to take advantage of new features and improvements.
- **Improved Documentation**: Improving the documentation to help contributors and maintainers understand the codebase better.
- **Better Test Coverage**: Increasing test coverage to ensure the application's stability and reliability.
- **Authentication and Security**: Enhancing the authentication and security features. Implementing WebAuthN, OAuth, Two-Factor Authentication or non-password-based authentication methods.
- **Dark Mode**: Implementing a dark mode theme for better user experience.
